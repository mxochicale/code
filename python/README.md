> ...In December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project 
that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. 
My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, 
and not much else on my hands. 
I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language 
I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal 
to Unix/C hackers. 
I chose Python as a working title for the project, 
being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).

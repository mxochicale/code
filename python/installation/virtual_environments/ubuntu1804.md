Virtual environments
---

Virtual environments enable you to have an isolated space on your 
computer for Python projects, ensuring that each of your projects 
can have its own set of dependencies that won’t disrupt any of 
your other projects.

Setting up a programming environment provides us with greater control 
over our Python projects and over how different versions of 
packages are handled. This is especially important when working 
with third-party packages.

You can set up as many Python programming environments as you want. 
Each environment is basically a directory or folder in your computer 
that has a few scripts in it to make it act as an environment.

## dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
```


We need to first install the venv module, part of the standard 
Python 3 library, so that we can create virtual environments. 
Let’s install venv venv by typing:

```
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
```

There are many ways to learn to code but maybe one important
skills is how to learn with purpose. I belive that at one point
of our lifes we have to face the annoying questions: do I need a job?
Hahaha, probably the answer woould be yes, with that in mind,
I have founded this video of Siraj Raval who give great advice 
for sucessed in a programming interview for the year 2018 [:link:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KB5KAak6tM).
I will be citing in this place some other sources 
that might help to improve my coding skills in python.

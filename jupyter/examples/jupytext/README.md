> Jupyter Notebooks as Markdown Documents, Julia, Python or R scripts

> When developing Jupyter Notebooks on a team, the DIFFs from git can be either hard to read or at least a nuisance to compare unnecessary items that are part of the Jupyter Notebook structure. There are resources such as nbdime, add-ons to IDEs, or even software that you may license that will provide better DIFFs for Jupyter Notebooks.

## Running notebooks
* Open a terminal and type:
```
#cd $HOME
conda activate simpleVE && jupyter notebook --browser=firefox
```
* Press `QUIT` to exit and close your web-browser! 
* To see execute time go to `Edit>nbextensions config` and activate Execute Time!

## Notes
* py works good ignoring its syncronised version hijupytext.ipynb
